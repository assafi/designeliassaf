I've chose the "Paul_J" API for this assigment. the decision was mainly because I understood 
the design quite fast. the author attached a test suite and a complete javadoc guide on how to 
extend his API, which made it my work much easier. The only thing I needed to add was an iterator()
method, which exposes the inner guts of the table components. 

The other API's were less easy to get into. one of them was lacking a test suite which could have
shown a usage example, while the other one had small issues which didn't fill right, like type definition, 
and table creation.
